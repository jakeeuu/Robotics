   rolling_window: true  # The local costmap moves with the robot, keeping the robot centered.
   width: 6.0  # Width of the local costmap in meters. Defines the horizontal extent of the map around the robot.
   height: 6.0  # Height of the local costmap in meters. Defines the vertical extent of the map around the robot.
   resolution: 0.05  # Resolution of the local costmap in meters/cell.
